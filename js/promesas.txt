That is a promise. A promise has 3 states. They are:

    Promise is pending: You don't know if you will get that phone until next week.
    Promise is resolved: Your mom really buy you a brand new phone.
    Promise is rejected: You don't get a new phone because your mom is not happy.

var isMomHappy = false;

// Promise
var willIGetNewPhone = new Promise(
    function (resolve, reject) {
        if (isMomHappy) {
            var phone = {
                brand: 'Samsung',
                color: 'black'
            };
            resolve(phone); // fulfilled (cumplido)
        } else {
            var reason = new Error('mom is not happy');
            reject(reason); // reject
        }

    }
);


/ promise syntax look like this:

new Promise(/* executor*/ function (resolve, reject) { ... } );

What you need to remember is, when the result is successful, call resolve(your_success_value), 
if the result fails, call reject(your_fail_value) in your promise. In our example, if mom is happy,
 we will get a phone. Therefore, we call resolve function with phone variable. If mom is not happy, we will 
 call reject function with a reason reject(reason);
